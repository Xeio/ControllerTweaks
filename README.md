# ControllerTweaks
 Tweaks to ESO's Controller UI

Adds some functionality to the default controller UI, such as junk/research indicators in the standard inventory, and a quick-junk hotkey for controller.

Adds support in the gamepad chat window to travel to group, guild, or friends (if they've recently typed in chat).

Settings, including keybinds, are controlled in the Add-On options menu opened with **/controllertweaks**.
