# ControllerTweaks
 Tweaks to ESO's Controller UI

This add-on is a hodgepodge of tweaks to ESO's default controller/gamepad UI to make the controller experience a bit nicer. Configure options by using **/controllertweaks** chat command.

Inventory:
* Shows Junk indicators, and researchable indicators in the inventory
* Adds controller hotkey to mark item as junk
* Hotkeys are configurable in settings (destroy/junk/stack)
* If PersonalAssistant addon is installed, adds "Mark as Permanent Junk" option to Actions menu
* If TamrielTradeCentre is installed, shows abbreviated TTC price information in item popups

Dungeon Finder:
* Shows entries for active Pledge quests at the top of the Specific Dungeon list

Mail:
* Hotkey to delete all mail with no attachments

Loot Panel:
* Adds verticle offset to the loot popup panel (configurable in options). No more loot displayed behind the chat window.

Crafting:
* Hides low level (below champion 160) recipes by default. Can be shown again using the Actions menu toggles.

Gamepad Chat:
* Allows quick traveling to guild members, group members, or friends (that have recently chatted) through the controller chat interface
